### Introduction
This simple extension introduces several common lobby utilities for exclusive use on BattleAsya. Most of the messages and parameters were hard-coded (i.e., non-configurable).<p>

BattleAsya has been using this extension on its lobby instance ever since 2021. Until today, the extension still provides a list of useful in-service utilities to back up BattleAsya's daily operations. <p>
